This assumes you have deployed the hosts declared in ansible-hosts.txt

So to bootstrap the cluster issue:
ansible-playbook -i ansible-hosts.txt full-install.yml

Notes:
1. The CNI used here is calico
2. The cluster is deployed on ubuntu jammy release
3. My username is used, change it for yours.

Dashboard
This includes the k8s dashboard so deploy the rbac.yaml to generate the resources.
After deploying issue this:
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard create token admin-user
Use the previous token to access the dashboard after doing this
ssh -L 8001:127.0.0.1:8001 server
kubectl proxy
http://localhost:8008/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/
--
Access the cluster locally
1. Copy the /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf to your local pc
2. Export the envvar KUBECONFIG to use that file.
